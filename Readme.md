Genetic Algorithm and Bees Algorithm for academic labolatories
Genetic:
	multiple crossovers
	inversion
	mutation
	few selections

Bees Algorithm:
1. Random positions
2. Remember best one
3. Choose best solutions 
-> from them choose elite and rest
4. Mutate elite and rest k-times
5. Choose nep/nsp from mutated solutions
6. Create new population from:
	best one from the beginning
	nep & nsp solutions,
	missing space fill with new randoms
Go to 2. untill stop condition
